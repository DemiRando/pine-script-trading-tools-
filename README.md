# Pine Script Trading Tools

A collection of custom Pine Script indicators focused on market structure, liquidity, and execution logic.

These scripts are designed as modular components that can be used standalone or combined into larger strategies.

## Included Tools
- Impulse Detector – identifies volatility expansion and displacement
- Swing Structure Tracker – tracks HH/HL/LH/LL and swing levels
- Supply & Demand Zones – builds and manages zones

## Design Philosophy
- Mechanical, rule-based logic
- Minimal visual clutter
- Designed for integration into strategies or alerts
- Focus on robustness over curve-fitting

## Notes
- Some indicators may repaint by design (noted per module)
- Logic can be adapted to specific needs/requirements

## About
I build Pine Script tools for TradingView, ranging from simple indicators to structured execution components.
